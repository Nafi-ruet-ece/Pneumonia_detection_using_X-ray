# Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-Ray Images

###  Project Overview
This project implements a **deep learning-based classifier** that automatically detects the presence of **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained and evaluated in Google Colab.

The main goal is to build a binary classifier that can distinguish between **normal** and **pneumonia-affected** chest X-ray scans using image features extracted by a deep learning model.

##  Methodology

1. **Dataset:**  
   A publicly available chest X-ray dataset with images labeled as *Normal* or *Pneumonia*. The dataset is typically organized into train/test/validation folders with respective subfolders for each class. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

2. **Model Architecture:**  
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
   - Preprocessing: image resizing, normalization, class balancing  
   - Training done in Google Colab with GPU acceleration

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**  
   - Accuracy  
   - Loss  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   -  ROC / AUC

##  How to Run

###  Option 1 — Google Colab
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Mount your dataset (from Kaggle or Google Drive)  
3. Run all cells to preprocess, train, and evaluate the model

###  Option 2 — Download & Local
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nafi-ruet-ece/Pneumonia_detection_using_X-ray.git
   📂 paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

This project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, commonly found on Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled chest X-ray images separated into Normal and Pneumonia categories.
